# Chapter Two: Pulling The Strings

## Installing VirtualBox, Vagrant and our Base Image.

Open up your browser, and head to [virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org/). This is the Virtualization software that we'll be using in the examples. If you have something else that you want to use, by all means, go right ahead and use it.

Click "Downloads" on the left sidebar, and then select the right version for your operating system. When you're done installing VirtualBox,  head over to [vagrantup.com](http://vagrantup.com), and then follow their instructions to install Vagrant.


Once that's done, download the Vagrantfile from [GitHub](https://github.com/SnowyPenguinSolutions/Finger-Puppeteering-Companion-Code).

Run the command `vagrant up` from inside the git repository that you just downloaded, and wait for it all to download. Then, run `vagrant halt`.

## Installing Puppet.

In order to *use* puppet, you kind of have to install it first, you know? Below we have instructions on how to install puppet.

Because of the rapid development pace of puppet, we are going to be using the repositories that puppetlabs provides.


### Debian-Based (Ubuntu, Debian).

### RPM-Based (Fedora, CentOS).
