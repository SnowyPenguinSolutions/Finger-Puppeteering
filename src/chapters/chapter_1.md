# Chapter One: What Is Puppet?


> What is Puppet?

This is a question that over the past 2 years I've heard (and asked) many times. It's different to different people. 

For the folks at [Puppet Labs](https://puppetlabs.com/), it's their dayjob to make puppet *awesome*.

For the people at [RackSpace](http://rackspace.com/), it's an important part of managing their infrastructure which runs thousands of websites.

For the operations team at [GitHub](https://github.com), it has been a very important part of [their lifestyle](https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops).


But for most people, Puppet is a way of doing something we call 

<h2>Infrastructure As Code.</h2>

We'll dig into this more shortly.

## Why Do We Care?

The answer is...

<h1>We Don't.</h1><h4>Yet.</h4>

## A Few Notes.

The demos in this book will be using a 12.04 LTS Ubuntu Server machine. While I do provide examples of how to install for RPM-based distros, you will need to change package names, if you choose to learn via that route. I highly recommend that you download an ISO and install it somewhere, or [use Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/), with the precise32 box (link below).
